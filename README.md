# A/B Testing 

## What is A/B Testing?
A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method used in the field of statistics and marketing to compare two or more versions of a webpage, email, advertisement, or any other element with the goal of determining which version performs better. It is a controlled experiment where different variations (A and B) of a single element are presented to different groups of users or customers, and their responses or behaviors are analyzed to identify which version yields better outcomes.
